            The tool is supported by volentary efforts and users can not expect to get help other than from emails.<br>

            The company account is private and secure for your company and your users, we would however not recomend that highly secret or sensitive information is placed in PrioCloud.<br>
            We aim at having an constant uptime, but the system can have planned downtime, announced on this page.<br>
            For security reasons Priocloud can not create new users for an company account or help with passwords, that is for the Administrator in your company.<br></i>
